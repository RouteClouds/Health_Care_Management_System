### 6. What is the current authentication system implementation and how does JWT token management work?

**Answer:** The platform implements a comprehensive JWT-based authentication system:

**Backend JWT Implementation:**
- JWT tokens expire in 24 hours with configurable expiration
- Tokens include user ID, username, email, and role information
- Secret key managed through environment variables
- Token verification with proper error handling for invalid/expired tokens

**Frontend Token Management:**
- Automatic token storage in localStorage as `routeclouds_token`
- Client-side token expiration checking and validation
- Automatic token injection in API requests via Axios interceptors
- Automatic logout and cleanup on token expiration

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User submits credentials to `/api/auth/login`
2. Backend validates and generates JWT token
3. Frontend stores token and updates Redux state
4. All subsequent API calls include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
5. Backend middleware validates tokens on protected routes

**Security Features:**
- bcrypt password hashing with 12 rounds
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Automatic token cleanup on 401/403 errors
- CORS configuration for secure frontend-backend communication

### 7. How is the database schema structured and what are the relationships between entities?

**Answer:** The database uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM and follows a relational structure:

**Core Entities:**
- **User:** Authentication and basic profile (id, username, email, password, firstName, lastName, role)
- **Doctor:** Medical professional details (specialization, qualifications, experience, consultation fees)
- **Department:** Medical departments (Cardiology, Pulmonology, Neurology, Orthopedics, Nephrology)
- **Appointment:** Booking system (dateTime, type, status, notes)

**Entity Relationships:**
- **User ↔ Appointment:** One-to-Many (Users as patients can have multiple appointments)
- **Doctor ↔ Appointment:** One-to-Many (Doctors can have multiple appointments)
- **Department ↔ Doctor:** One-to-Many (Departments contain multiple doctors)
- **Role-based System:** Users have roles (PATIENT, DOCTOR, ADMIN)

**Appointment Types & Status:**
- Types: IN_PERSON, TELEMEDICINE
- Status: SCHEDULED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, NO_SHOW

**Sample Data:**
- 5 doctors across 5 medical departments
- Complete department structure with codes and descriptions
- Proper foreign key constraints and audit timestamps

### 8. What is the API architecture and what are the available endpoints?

**Answer:** The API follows RESTful principles with Express.js and comprehensive endpoint coverage:

**Server Configuration:**
- Base URL: `http://localhost:3001/api` (development)
- CORS enabled for frontend at localhost:5173
- Security middleware (Helmet), logging (Morgan), JSON parsing

**Authentication Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login (returns JWT token)
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get current user profile (protected)

**Doctor Management Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/doctors` - Get all doctors (with pagination, search, filtering)
- `GET /api/doctors/:id` - Get specific doctor details
- `GET /api/doctors/department/:departmentCode` - Get doctors by department
- `GET /api/doctors/departments/all` - Get all departments with doctor counts
- `GET /api/doctors/stats` - API statistics and metrics

**Appointment Management Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/appointments/availability/:doctorId/:date` - Get available time slots (public)
- `GET /api/appointments` - Get user appointments (protected)
- `POST /api/appointments` - Create new appointment (protected)
- `PUT /api/appointments/:id` - Update appointment (protected)
- `DELETE /api/appointments/:id` - Cancel appointment (protected)

**System Endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Health check and system status
- `GET /api` - API information and available endpoints

**Response Format:**
All responses follow consistent JSON structure with success/error status, data payload, and descriptive messages.

**Security:**
- JWT-based authentication with Bearer token authorization
- Protected route middleware for sensitive operations
- Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### 9. How is state management implemented across the frontend using Redux Toolkit and React Query for server state?

**Answer:** The frontend uses a **hybrid state management approach** combining Redux Toolkit for client state and React Query for server state:

**Architecture Overview:**
- **Redux Toolkit:** Manages authentication state, UI state, and application-level data
- **React Query:** Handles all server state including API calls, caching, and synchronization
- **Hybrid Integration:** Both systems work together for optimal performance and developer experience

**Redux Toolkit Implementation:**
```typescript
// Store configuration with multiple slices
export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    auth: authReducer,           // User authentication state
    appointments: appointmentReducer, // UI state for appointments
  },
});

// Authentication state management
const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'auth',
  initialState: {
    user: null,
    token: null,
    isAuthenticated: false,
    loading: false,
  },
  reducers: {
    setCredentials: (state, action) => {
      state.user = action.payload.user;
      state.token = action.payload.token;
      state.isAuthenticated = true;
    },
    logout: (state) => {
      state.user = null;
      state.token = null;
      state.isAuthenticated = false;
    },
  },
});
```

**React Query Implementation:**
```typescript
// Query client with optimized caching
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      retry: 2,
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      gcTime: 10 * 60 * 1000,   // 10 minutes
    },
  },
});

// Doctor data management
export const useDoctors = (params?: DoctorParams) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['doctors', params],
    queryFn: () => doctorService.getDoctors(params),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  });
};

// Appointment mutations with cache invalidation
export const useCreateAppointment = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: appointmentService.createAppointment,
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['appointments'] });
      toast.success('Appointment created successfully!');
    },
  });
};
```

**State Management Patterns:**
- **Client State (Redux):** Authentication, UI state, form data, navigation
- **Server State (React Query):** API responses, doctor data, appointments, search results
- **Cache Management:** Hierarchical query keys for efficient invalidation
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error management with toast notifications
- **Performance:** Optimistic updates, background refetching, intelligent caching

**Integration Features:**
- **Authentication Flow:** Redux stores user state, React Query handles auth API calls
- **Persistent State:** Auth state persists across browser sessions
- **Real-time Updates:** Automatic cache invalidation on data mutations
- **Loading States:** Coordinated loading indicators across both systems

### 10. What is the deployment strategy and what environment variables are required for both development and production setups?

**Answer:** The platform supports multiple deployment strategies with Docker containerization and AWS cloud deployment:

**Deployment Architecture:**
- **Development:** Local Docker Compose setup with hot reloading
- **Staging:** Docker containers with production-like configuration
- **Production:** AWS ECS with Fargate, RDS database, and Load Balancer
- **Containerization:** Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized images
