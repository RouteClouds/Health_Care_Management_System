- ✅ All EKS clusters in region
- ✅ CloudFormation stacks (healthcare-related)
- ✅ EC2 instances with cluster tags
- ✅ Load balancers (ELB/ALB)
- ✅ VPCs created by eksctl
- ✅ Security groups
- ✅ Current cost impact analysis

**Example Output**:
```bash
☁️ CloudFormation Stacks (healthcare related):
Name                                    Status              Created
eksctl-healthcare-cluster-cluster       CREATE_COMPLETE     2025-08-01T10:30:00Z
eksctl-healthcare-cluster-nodegroup     CREATE_COMPLETE     2025-08-01T10:45:00Z

🌐 VPCs (eksctl related):
VpcId           State    CidrBlock        Name
vpc-0123456789  available 192.168.0.0/16  eksctl-healthcare-cluster-cluster/VPC
```

### **Step 3: Enhanced Comprehensive Cleanup (10-20 minutes)**
```bash
./cleanup-cloudformation.sh
```

**🔧 What This Script Does**:

#### **Phase 1: CloudFormation Stack Deletion**
```bash
✅ Identifies all healthcare-related stacks
✅ Deletes in correct dependency order:
   1. Nodegroup stacks first
   2. Cluster stacks second
   3. Other related stacks last
✅ Waits for complete deletion before proceeding
```

#### **Phase 2: Force Delete Stuck Resources**
```bash
✅ EC2 Instances:
   • Finds instances with kubernetes.io/cluster/healthcare-cluster tags
   • Terminates all instances
   • Waits for termination completion

✅ Load Balancers:
   • Identifies ELB/ALB with k8s or healthcare names
   • Deletes load balancers
   • Waits 30 seconds for deletion propagation

✅ NAT Gateways (Cost Priority):
   • Finds NAT Gateways with eksctl-healthcare tags
   • Deletes immediately (saves ~$45/month each)
   • Waits 60 seconds for deletion

✅ Elastic IPs:
   • Releases EIPs associated with NAT Gateways
   • Prevents ongoing charges
```

#### **Phase 3: Comprehensive VPC Cleanup**
```bash
✅ For each VPC with eksctl-healthcare tags:

   🔌 Network Interfaces (ENIs):
   • Deletes all ENIs in the VPC
   • Handles attached/detached interfaces

   🔒 Security Groups:
   • Deletes all non-default security groups
   • Handles dependency conflicts

   🏠 Subnets:
   • Deletes all subnets in the VPC
   • Waits for resource dependencies

   🌍 Internet Gateways:
   • Detaches IGW from VPC first
   • Then deletes the IGW

   🛣️ Route Tables:
   • Deletes all non-main route tables
   • Preserves main route table until VPC deletion

   🗑️ VPC:
   • Final VPC deletion after all components removed
```

#### **Phase 4: Real-time Verification**
```bash
✅ Checks each resource type after deletion:
   • EKS cluster status
   • CloudFormation stacks
   • EC2 instances
   • Load balancers
   • NAT Gateways
   • VPCs and networking
   • Security groups
   • Subnets
   • Internet gateways
   • Route tables

✅ Provides immediate feedback:
   • ✅ Resource deleted successfully
   • ❌ Resource still exists (with specific ID)
   • 💰 Cost impact analysis
```

**Example Output**:
```bash
🔍 Processing VPC: vpc-0123456789
   🔌 Deleting ENIs...
     Deleting ENI: eni-0abcdef123
   🔒 Deleting Security Groups...
     Deleting Security Group: sg-0xyz789
   🏠 Deleting Subnets...
     Deleting Subnet: subnet-0abc123
   🌍 Deleting Internet Gateways...
     Detaching and deleting IGW: igw-0def456
   🛣️ Deleting Route Tables...
     Deleting Route Table: rtb-0ghi789
   🗑️ Deleting VPC: vpc-0123456789
   ✅ VPC vpc-0123456789 cleanup completed

🎉 SUCCESS: All healthcare cluster resources have been completely removed!
💰 Cost Impact: $0.00/hour (no active resources)
🚀 Ready to create new cluster: ./create-eks-cluster.sh
```

### **Step 4: Final Verification (3 minutes)**
```bash
./verify-complete-cleanup.sh
```

**🔍 Comprehensive Verification Checks**:

#### **18 Resource Type Verification**
```bash
✅ EKS Clusters
✅ CloudFormation Stacks
✅ EC2 Instances
✅ Load Balancers (ELB/ALB)
✅ Security Groups
✅ VPCs
✅ NAT Gateways
✅ Internet Gateways
✅ Route Tables
✅ Subnets
✅ Elastic IPs
✅ Network ACLs
✅ Network Interfaces
✅ Auto Scaling Groups
✅ Launch Templates
✅ IAM Roles
✅ kubectl contexts
✅ Cost-generating resources scan
```

**Example Success Output**:
```bash
✅ EKS cluster: Deleted
✅ CloudFormation stacks: All deleted
✅ EC2 instances: All terminated
✅ Load balancers: All deleted
✅ NAT Gateways: All deleted
✅ VPCs: All deleted
✅ Security Groups: All deleted
✅ Subnets: All deleted
✅ Internet Gateways: All deleted
✅ Route Tables: All deleted

🎉 SUCCESS: Complete cleanup verified!
💰 Cost Impact: $0.00/hour (no active resources)
🚀 You can now safely create a new cluster: ./create-eks-cluster.sh
```

### **Step 4.5: Emergency - Force Delete Failed Stack (2-5 minutes)**
**⚠️ Use this ONLY if you get "Stack already exists" error when creating new cluster**

```bash
./force-delete-failed-stack.sh
```

**🚨 When to Use This Script**:

#### **Scenario: DELETE_FAILED Stack Blocking New Cluster**
```bash
❌ Symptoms:
   • Error: "Stack [eksctl-healthcare-cluster-cluster] already exists"
   • Cluster creation fails immediately
   • diagnose-aws-resources.sh shows stack with DELETE_FAILED status
   • Previous cleanup scripts completed but cluster creation still fails

✅ Root Cause:
   • CloudFormation stack failed to delete due to resource dependencies
   • Stack remains in DELETE_FAILED state in AWS
   • eksctl cannot create new stack with same name
   • Stuck resources (usually subnets, ENIs, or security groups)
```

**🔧 What This Script Does**:

#### **Smart DELETE_FAILED Stack Handling**
```bash
✅ Identifies stack status (DELETE_FAILED, DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, etc.)
✅ Shows specific resources that failed to delete
✅ Uses AWS CloudFormation retain-resources option
✅ Removes stack record while preserving stuck resources
✅ Enables new cluster creation with same name
✅ Provides detailed status reporting
```

#### **Example Output**:
```bash
🔍 Checking stack status...
📋 Current stack status: DELETE_FAILED
🚨 Stack is in DELETE_FAILED state - this is blocking new cluster creation

📋 Resources in the failed stack:
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Type  |  AWS::EC2::Subnet                                                                 |
|  Id    |  subnet-01b7b29512e9d9459                                                         |
|  Status|  DELETE_FAILED                                                                    |
|  Reason|  The subnet has dependencies and cannot be deleted                               |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

🗑️ Force deleting stack: eksctl-healthcare-cluster-cluster
✅ Stack deletion initiated with resource retention
✅ Stack successfully deleted!
🚀 You can now create a new cluster: ./create-eks-cluster.sh
```

**💡 Why Resource Retention Works**:
```bash
✅ Removes CloudFormation stack record from AWS
✅ Leaves stuck resources in place (they'll be cleaned up by new cluster)
✅ Allows eksctl to create fresh stack with same name
✅ New cluster creation will handle resource conflicts automatically
✅ Cost impact: Minimal (stuck resources usually low-cost)
```

**🔍 When NOT to Use This Script**:
```bash
❌ Don't use if normal cleanup scripts haven't been run first
❌ Don't use if no "Stack already exists" error occurs
❌ Don't use if stack is in DELETE_IN_PROGRESS (wait for completion)
❌ Don't use for production clusters without backup verification
```

### **Step 5: Create New Cluster (15-20 minutes)**
```bash
# Only run after verification passes
./create-eks-cluster.sh
```

## **🔧 Advanced Features**

### **🎯 Smart Dependency Handling**
```bash
✅ Correct deletion order prevents dependency conflicts
✅ Waits for resource state changes before proceeding
✅ Handles AWS eventual consistency delays
✅ Retries failed operations with exponential backoff
```

### **💰 Cost Optimization**
```bash
✅ Prioritizes expensive resource deletion:
   • NAT Gateways: ~$45/month each (deleted first)
   • Load Balancers: ~$20/month each
   • EC2 instances: Variable cost
   • Elastic IPs: $3.65/month if unattached

✅ Real-time cost impact reporting
✅ Identifies hidden cost-generating resources
```

### **🔍 Comprehensive Error Handling**
```bash
✅ Specific error messages with resource IDs
✅ Manual cleanup commands provided
✅ AWS CLI troubleshooting guidance
✅ Support escalation recommendations
```

### **⚡ Performance Optimization**
```bash
✅ Parallel deletion where possible
✅ Optimal wait times for AWS propagation
✅ Efficient resource discovery queries
✅ Minimal API calls to reduce execution time
```

## **🚨 Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: Resources Still Exist After Cleanup**
```bash
Symptom: Verification shows remaining resources
Solution:
1. Wait 10-15 minutes for AWS propagation
2. Re-run: ./cleanup-cloudformation.sh
3. Check AWS Console for stuck resources
4. Use provided manual cleanup commands
```

#### **Issue 2: CloudFormation Stack Stuck in DELETE_IN_PROGRESS**
```bash
Symptom: Stack deletion takes >30 minutes
Solution:
1. Check CloudFormation console for specific errors
2. Manually delete stuck resources blocking stack deletion
3. Contact AWS support for assistance
```

#### **Issue 3: VPC Cannot Be Deleted**
```bash
Symptom: VPC deletion fails with dependency error
Solution:
1. Run diagnose script to identify remaining dependencies
2. Manually delete ENIs, security groups, or subnets
3. Re-run cleanup script
```

#### **Issue 4: CloudFormation Stack in DELETE_FAILED State**
```bash
Symptom: Error "Stack [eksctl-healthcare-cluster-cluster] already exists"
Root Cause: Previous stack deletion failed, leaving stack in DELETE_FAILED state
Solution:
1. Run: ./diagnose-aws-resources.sh (confirm DELETE_FAILED status)
2. Run: ./force-delete-failed-stack.sh
3. Confirm stack deletion with resource retention
4. Retry cluster creation: ./create-eks-cluster.sh

Technical Details:
• DELETE_FAILED occurs when resources have dependencies
• Common stuck resources: subnets, ENIs, security groups
• Force deletion uses --retain-resources to skip stuck resources
• New cluster creation handles resource conflicts automatically
```

#### **Issue 5: Permission Denied Errors**
```bash
Symptom: AWS CLI commands fail with access denied
Solution:
1. Verify AWS credentials: aws sts get-caller-identity
2. Check IAM permissions for EC2, EKS, CloudFormation
3. Ensure region is correct (us-east-1)
```

## **🚨 Emergency Procedures**

### **🔥 If Scripts Fail Completely**
```bash
Manual cleanup order:
1. Terminate all EC2 instances manually
2. Delete load balancers from EC2 console
3. Delete NAT gateways (most expensive)
4. Release Elastic IPs
5. Delete CloudFormation stacks manually
6. Clean up VPC components in order:
   - ENIs → Security Groups → Subnets → IGW → Route Tables → VPC
```

### **📞 When to Contact AWS Support**
```bash
Contact AWS Support if:
• CloudFormation stack stuck >2 hours in DELETE_IN_PROGRESS
• Resources show as deleted but still appear in billing
• Permission errors despite correct IAM policies
• VPC deletion fails with unknown dependencies
• NAT Gateway deletion fails repeatedly
```

### **💾 Data Recovery**
```bash
If you need to recover data:
• EBS snapshots may still exist (check EC2 console)
• Application data should be backed up separately
• Kubernetes manifests should be in version control
• Database backups should be external to cluster
```
