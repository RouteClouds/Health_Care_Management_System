echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ DIAGNOSE CURRENT STATE"
echo "   ./diagnose-aws-resources.sh"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Shows all existing healthcare-related AWS resources"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Identifies what needs to be cleaned up"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Provides cost impact analysis"
echo ""

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP"
echo "   ./cleanup-cloudformation.sh"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Deletes CloudFormation stacks in correct order"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Force deletes stuck EC2 instances"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Removes load balancers and waits for completion"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Deletes NAT Gateways (cost-saving priority)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Releases Elastic IPs"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Comprehensive VPC cleanup:"
echo "     - Network interfaces"
echo "     - Security groups"
echo "     - Subnets"
echo "     - Internet gateways"
echo "     - Route tables"
echo "     - VPCs"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Final verification with detailed status"
echo ""

echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ VERIFICATION"
echo "   ./verify-complete-cleanup.sh"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Double-checks all resource types"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Verifies no cost-generating resources remain"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Confirms readiness for new cluster creation"

echo "4Ô∏è‚É£ CREATE NEW CLUSTER"

echo "   ‚Ä¢ Only run after complete verification passes"

echo "‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:"
echo "==================="
echo "‚Ä¢ The enhanced cleanup script now handles VPC deletion properly"
echo "‚Ä¢ It will delete ALL networking components in the correct order"
echo "‚Ä¢ NAT Gateways are prioritized for deletion (they cost ~$45/month)"
echo "‚Ä¢ The script waits for resources to be fully deleted before proceeding"
echo "‚Ä¢ Final verification ensures nothing is left behind"
echo "‚Ä¢ If any resources remain, you'll get specific error messages"
echo ""

echo "üí∞ Cost Impact:"
echo "==============="
echo "‚Ä¢ Current issue: VPC resources may be incurring charges"
echo "‚Ä¢ After cleanup: $0.00/hour (all resources removed)"
echo "‚Ä¢ NAT Gateways are the most expensive component (~$45/month each)"
echo ""

echo "üîß Troubleshooting:"
echo "==================="
echo "If cleanup fails:"
echo "1. Wait 10-15 minutes for AWS propagation"
echo "2. Re-run ./cleanup-cloudformation.sh"
echo "3. Check AWS Console for stuck resources"
echo "4. Use AWS CLI commands provided in verification output"
echo "5. Contact AWS support for stuck resources"
