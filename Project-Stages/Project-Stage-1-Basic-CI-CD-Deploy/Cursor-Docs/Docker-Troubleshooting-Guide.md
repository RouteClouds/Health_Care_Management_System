## 🚨 **Issue #1: Backend Container Startup Failure - Missing Start Script**

### **🎯 Issue Description**
Backend container was failing to start with repeated restart attempts, showing `CrashLoopBackOff` behavior.

### **🔍 Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Step 1: Check Container Status**
```bash
# Command
docker compose ps

# Output
NAME                  IMAGE                 COMMAND                  SERVICE    CREATED
  STATUS                           PORTS
healthcare-backend    healthcare-backend    "docker-entrypoint.s…"   backend    44 seconds ago 
  Restarting (127) 8 seconds ago
healthcare-db         postgres:15-alpine    "docker-entrypoint.s…"   database   About a minute ago 
  Up About a minute (healthy)      0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, [::]:5432->5432/tcp
```

#### **Step 2: Check Backend Logs**
```bash
# Command
docker compose logs backend

# Output
healthcare-backend  | /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: exec: line 11: ./scripts/start.sh: not found
healthcare-backend  | /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: exec: line 11: ./scripts/start.sh: not found
healthcare-backend  | /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: exec: line 11: ./scripts/start.sh: not found
```

#### **Step 3: Analyze Dockerfile Configuration**
```bash
# Check Dockerfile.backend
cat Dockerfile.backend

# Found the issue in the CMD line:
CMD ["./scripts/start.sh"]
```

**Root Cause Identified:**
- ✅ **Script Exists**: `start.sh` file exists in `backend/scripts/`
- ✅ **Script Content**: Script content is correct
- ❌ **Permission Issue**: Script not executable in container
- ❌ **Path Issue**: Script not found during container startup

### **🛠️ Troubleshooting Approach**

#### **Step 1: Verify Script Existence and Permissions**
```bash
# Command
ls -la backend/scripts/

# Output
-rw-rw-r--  1 ubuntu ubuntu  562 Jul 28 06:28 start.sh
-rw-rw-r--  1 ubuntu ubuntu 4.6K Jul 28 06:28 init-db.sh

# Issue: Scripts are not executable
```

#### **Step 2: Fix Script Permissions**
```bash
# Command
chmod +x backend/scripts/*.sh

# Verify
ls -la backend/scripts/
# Output
-rwxrwxr-x  1 ubuntu ubuntu  562 Jul 28 06:28 start.sh
-rwxrwxr-x  1 ubuntu ubuntu 4.6K Jul 28 06:28 init-db.sh
```

#### **Step 3: Rebuild Backend Image**
```bash
# Command
docker compose build backend

# Output

```

**Issue Persisted**: The script permission fix didn't resolve the issue.

### **✅ Solution Implementation**

#### **Alternative Approach: Simplify Startup Command**
Since the script approach was problematic, we simplified the Dockerfile to use direct npm command:

```bash
# Edit Dockerfile.backend
# BEFORE:
CMD ["./scripts/start.sh"]

# AFTER:
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### **Apply the Fix:**
```bash
# Command
docker compose down && docker compose build backend && docker compose up -d

# Output

## 🚨 **Issue #2: Frontend Container - Nginx Upstream Configuration Error**

### **🎯 Issue Description**
Frontend container was failing to start due to nginx configuration error: "host not found in upstream 'backend-service'".

### **🔍 Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Step 1: Check Frontend Logs**
```bash
# Command
docker compose logs frontend

# Output
healthcare-frontend  | /docker-entrypoint.sh: Configuration complete; ready for start up
healthcare-frontend  | 2025/08/01 03:37:02 [emerg] 1#1: host not found in upstream "backend-service" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:82
healthcare-frontend  | nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream "backend-service" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:82
healthcare-frontend  | /docker-entrypoint.sh: /docker-entrypoint.d/ is not empty, will attempt to perform configuration
healthcare-frontend  | /docker-entrypoint.sh: Looking for shell scripts in /docker-entrypoint.d/

healthcare-frontend  | 10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh: info: Enabled listen on IPv6 in /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
healthcare-frontend  | /docker-entrypoint.sh: Sourcing /docker-entrypoint.d/15-local-resolvers.envsh
healthcare-frontend  | /docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/20-envsubst-on-templates.sh
healthcare-frontend  | /docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/30-tune-worker-processes.sh

healthcare-frontend  | 2025/08/01 03:37:08 [emerg] 1#1: host not found in upstream "backend-service" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:82
```

#### **Step 2: Check Nginx Configuration**
```bash
# Command
cat nginx/frontend.conf | grep -n "backend-service"

# Output
82:            proxy_pass http://backend-service:3002;
```

#### **Step 3: Check Docker Compose Service Names**
```bash
# Command
grep -n "services:" docker-compose.yml

# Output shows service name is "backend", not "backend-service"
```

**Root Cause Identified:**
- ❌ **Nginx Config**: References `backend-service:3002`
- ✅ **Docker Compose**: Service name is `backend`
- ❌ **Mismatch**: Configuration doesn't match actual service name

### **✅ Solution Implementation**

#### **Fix Nginx Configuration**
```bash
# Edit nginx/frontend.conf
# BEFORE:
proxy_pass http://backend-service:3002;

# AFTER:
proxy_pass http://backend:3002;
```

#### **Apply the Fix:**
```bash
# Command
docker compose down && docker compose build frontend && docker compose up -d

# Output

### **Step 2: Test Backend Health**
```bash
# Command
curl -s http://localhost:3002/health | jq .

# Output
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Health Care Management System API is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T03:39:33.872Z",
  "environment": "development",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### **Step 3: Test Frontend Accessibility**
```bash
# Command
curl -I http://localhost:5173 | head -3

# Output
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.29.0
Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2025 03:39:33 GMT
```

### **Step 4: Test API Through Frontend Proxy**
```bash
# Command
curl -s http://localhost:5173/api/health | jq .

# Output
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "healthcare-backend",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T03:39:33.902Z",
  "uptime": 33.348264285,

## 📋 **Complete Troubleshooting Process Summary**

### **🔧 Issues Encountered and Fixed:**

1. **Backend Startup Script Issue**
   - **Problem**: `./scripts/start.sh: not found`
   - **Root Cause**: Script permissions and path issues in container
   - **Solution**: Changed CMD to `npm start` in Dockerfile
   - **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

2. **Frontend Nginx Upstream Configuration**
   - **Problem**: `host not found in upstream "backend-service"`
   - **Root Cause**: Nginx config referenced wrong service name
   - **Solution**: Changed `backend-service` to `backend` in nginx config
   - **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

### **🚀 Final Working Configuration:**

| Service | Status | URL | Health Check |
|---------|--------|-----|--------------|
| **Database** | ✅ Running | localhost:5432 | `pg_isready` |
| **Backend** | ✅ Running | localhost:3002 | `/health` |
| **Frontend** | ✅ Running | localhost:5173 | nginx response |
| **Nginx** | ✅ Running | localhost:80 | nginx health |

### **🌐 Application Access Points:**

- **Frontend Application**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API (Direct)**: http://localhost:3002
- **Backend API (Proxy)**: http://localhost:5173/api
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3002/health

## 🎯 **Key Lessons Learned**

### **1. Docker Build Best Practices**
- Always check script permissions before building images
- Use simple, direct commands in Dockerfile CMD when possible
- Verify service names match between docker-compose.yml and nginx configs

### **2. Troubleshooting Methodology**
- **Check container status first**: `docker compose ps`
- **Examine logs immediately**: `docker compose logs <service>`
- **Verify configuration files**: Check for mismatches between services
- **Test incrementally**: Fix one issue at a time

### **3. Common Docker Issues**
- **Script permissions**: Always `chmod +x` scripts before building
- **Service name mismatches**: Ensure nginx upstream matches docker-compose service names
- **Health check failures**: Check if services are actually ready before health checks run

### **4. Verification Process**
- **Container status**: All containers should show "healthy" or "running"
- **Port accessibility**: Test each service on its exposed port
- **Service communication**: Verify frontend can proxy to backend
- **API functionality**: Test actual endpoints, not just health checks

## 🔄 **Quick Reference Commands**

### **Build and Deploy:**
```bash
# Clean start
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans

# Build all images
docker compose build --no-cache

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Check status
docker compose ps
```

### **Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs <service-name>

# Rebuild specific service
docker compose build <service-name>

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart <service-name>

# Check container details
docker compose exec <service-name> sh
```

### **Testing:**
```bash
# Test backend
curl http://localhost:3002/health

# Test frontend
curl -I http://localhost:5173

# Test API through proxy
curl http://localhost:5173/api/health
```
